# Welcome to Research Dugnads! :wave:

This website is a collection of examples and advocacy for the concept of a Research Dugnad - a coming together of a research group or team to share knowledge, pass on skills, tidy and review code, among other software and working best practices.
The aim is to help research teams benefit from collaborative peer-to-peer learning of research software practices and tooling that helps streamline the day-to-day of performing research.

:thinking: If you'd like to know more about Research Dugnads and why we think they're beneficial, read our [Motivation]({{< ref "motivation" >}} "Motivation")

:envelope: You could even [invite your local Research Software Engineer]({{< ref "invite_an_rse" >}} "Invite an RSE") to share their experience and expertise

:books: Here's what a [Dugnad could look like]({{< ref "storytime" >}} "Story Time").
