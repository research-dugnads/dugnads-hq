# Why would you run a Research Dugnad?

## What is a dugnad?

['Dugnad' is a Norwegian word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_work#Norway) meaning voluntary collective work, for example, shared housing residents coming together to work on  shared garden space, or young school children tidying and decorating their classroom. In 2004 it was voted Norwegian word of the year, and in 2020 was used to encourage the people of Norway to come together as a community to fight the pandemic. A dugnad typically involves coming together as a group to share chores, but is also a fun and sociable occasion. They are sometimes followed by a meal where everyone brings some dishes to share. 

Modern research is [a collaborative effort](https://www.nature.com/news/2008/081008/full/455720a.html). Researchers in an insitution form groups studying similar topics or all working under the same Principal Investigator, meet with collages from nearby institutions for seminars and conferences, and paricipate in global collaborations with late night telecons reaching hundreds of people. Thjere are many tools facilitating and encouraging active communication between huge remote collaborations, but here we focus on smaller local scale collaboration: just one research group.

The core idea of a Research Dugnad is to take a day out of the hectic schedule of research, teaching and admin to come together as a group (physically or virtually) and perform tasks that benefit the group as a whole, share skills and have some fun. This goes beyond a regular group meeting where people might present their own work, ask for advice or share a paper they read and involves much more active input from everyone. We have prepared a list of tasks that might be useful to any research group and should enable everyone in the group to contribute something, but the agenda for the day should be carefully planned to match your group needs, skills, and location.
