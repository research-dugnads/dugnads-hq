This is time to collectively improve your shared environment. Your group probably already has ideas about what good parts of your software and practices could become great, and what&amp;hellip;not-so-good things there are that could also be improved. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already explicitly discussed this, you might want to set aside half an hour at the beginning of your dugnad to discuss what there is to be done and to record a list of activities: that&amp;rsquo;s actually how we built this template dugnad!</description></item><item><title>Motivation</title><link>https://research-dugnads.github.io/dugnads-hq/motivation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 10:59:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://research-dugnads.github.io/dugnads-hq/motivation/</guid><description>Why would you run a Research Dugnad? What is a dugnad? &amp;lsquo;Dugnad&amp;rsquo; is a Norwegian word meaning voluntary collective work, for example, shared housing residents coming together to work on shared garden space, or young school children tidying and decorating their classroom. In 2004 it was voted Norwegian word of the year, and in 2020 was used to encourage the people of Norway to come together as a community to fight the pandemic.</description></item></channel></rss>
