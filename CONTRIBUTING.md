# Introduction

## Welcome to the Research Dugnads HQ project!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Research Dugnads.
It's people like you that make Research Dugnads such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Research Dugnads is an open source project designed to bring research groups together to share knowledge and skills that are vital to research work, but are often not prioritised!
We love to receive contributions and feedback from our community â€” you!
There are many ways to contribute, from running a dugnad and telling us what did and didn't work for your group, writing blog posts on dugnads you've held, to improving the documentation and submitting bug reports.

## Ground Rules

To ensure your contribution is processed appropriately and in a timely manner, please consider the following ground rules when contributing to the project.

- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make.
  Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per Pull Request.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
  See the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through the issues labelled as `good first issue` or `help wanted`:

- `good first issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of changes, such as making clarifying changes to documentation
- `help wanted` - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues and may involve restructing an example agenda.

If you are new to GitHub, here are a couple of friendly tutorials to help you on your way: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

## Getting started

The first step to making a contribution is to check the open issues to make sure the contribution you'd like to make hasn't already been discussed.
You can then join the discussion on the topic there.
If you can't find a relevant issue, feel free to open a new one.

The purpose of opening an issue is to discuss the change with the project maintainers.
If they agree that your proposed contribution is within the scope of the project, they'll then suggest you open a pull request implementing the change.

If your change is considered out of scope for the project, it might not be because the maintainers think it's a bad idea, but rather it would be too much extra work for the maintainers to nurture this aspect of the project.

Now you are ready to open a Pull Request!

As a rule of thumb, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch following the convention `<feature | bugfix>/<issue-number>/<short description>`
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear commit messages
4. Open your Pull Request!
   Describe what your Pull Request is changing and use an action word like `fixes #3` to automatically close the related issue when the Pull Request is merged.

## Review process

The project maintainers will try to review Pull Requests in a timely manner.
If your Pull Request hasn't been reviewed or acknowledged within 14 days, please ping one of the team by `@`-mentioning them on the Pull Request.
However, please be respectful when taking this path as the maintaining team are volunteers.

The reviewer may ask you to make some changes before marking your Pull Request as ready to merge.
Please try to address these changes where possible and ask clarifying questions where things don't make sense.
